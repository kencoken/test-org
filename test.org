* Top-down estimating 7th Aug

** Last week

*** ANN code                                                           :Guil:
**** 2M images: 2 hrs to build index, 5 mins for 100k for lookup (10-NN), 3GB
*** ANN Metrics                                                        :Guil:
*** Filtering by distance                                              :Guil:
**** Make preds for dist < thresh -> 60% :: $5000 -> $2000 (flwing)
*** Explored existing features                                         :Guil:
**** concatenate image features (~100k)

** Discussion

*** MIL split
**** Filter on other parts 'undamaged' rather than 'no_operation'?
*** Distance functions
**** Cosine distance > Euclidean distance?
**** Maybe resolved by proper normalisation?
*** Metrics
**** % of claims w less than < 10% MAE (Ajay's metric)

** High-level

*** URR scores + metadata NN, conditioned on MMY                     :Marcel:
*** MIL RR frontal features + NN                                   :Ken:Guil:
**** Conditioned on MMY

**** (Clustered using k-means + filtered)
**** With added metadata salt
**** (later: metric learning on estimate value)

*** Failure cases
**** not enough claims (after conditioning on MMY)
- can we condense down further? (combine different Camry's etc.)
- clusters should definitely be big enough with MMY
**** NN doesn't work
- are these features relevant enough?
**** same type of damage leads to different estimates
- potentially addressed by adding _relevant_ metadata (-> later)

# what are the things the visual models don't have an incentive to learn? (but visually)
- labour hours?
-- just train another model on e.g. labour hours
-- add labour hours as MTL objective, and then use the feature space
